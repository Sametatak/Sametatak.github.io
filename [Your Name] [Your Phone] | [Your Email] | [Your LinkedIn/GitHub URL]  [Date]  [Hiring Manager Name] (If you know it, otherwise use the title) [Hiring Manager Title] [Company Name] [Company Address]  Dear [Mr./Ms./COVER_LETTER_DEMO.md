Dear [Mr./Ms./Mx. Last Name or Hiring Team],

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the [Role Name, e.g., Machine Learning Engineer Internship] at [Company Name]. As a senior Control and Automation Engineering student at Istanbul Technical University [cite: 8] with demonstrated research experience in ensemble learning [cite: 13, 329] and hands-on project experience in autonomous robotics[cite: 18], I am confident that my skills align perfectly with the requirements for this role.

My passion for machine learning is demonstrated by my recent position as a Machine Learning Researcher at the University of Kassel. During this internship, I authored a technical report on "Advancing Ensemble Regression"[cite: 329], where I focused on the automated hyperparameter tuning of ensemble models. This experience provided me with a deep understanding of model optimization, diversity-accuracy trade-offs [cite: 329], and computational experiments on high-performance servers[cite: 14].

In addition to my research background, I have practical experience as an Autonomous Robot Developer at Machine Arge[cite: 17]. In this role, I developed autonomous navigation algorithms using ROS [cite: 18], implemented path planning and obstacle avoidance [cite: 20], and worked extensively with STM32 microcontrollers [cite: 18] and sensors like Intel RealSense cameras and GPS-IMU systems[cite: 19]. This role solidified my ability to bridge the gap between high-level algorithms and real-world hardware implementation.

My commitment to autonomous systems extends beyond my professional experience. As a ROS team member for ITU Autobee, I was part of the team that won the 2023 NJORD Autonomous Ship Challenge [cite: 26] and became a finalist in the Teknofest TIKA Competition[cite: 26].

I am eager to bring my technical skills and practical experience in machine learning and robotics to [Company Name]. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.

Sincerely,
Samet Atak
